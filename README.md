*Git workflow used in this project:*

Based on this article about Git branching model 

(http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) 

We decided to use the following git workflow:

 master: official releases
 
 develop: integration branch for features
 
 feature: branches with "develop" as a common parent
